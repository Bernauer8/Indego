The integration uses the config flow in Homw Assistant combined with a Chrome plugin. Please see documentation on Github pages.


## Changed to config flow
You can not add this component to Home Assistant via `configuration.yaml` file anymore (since version 5.0).

Add this integration via Home Assistant Settings -> Devices & Services -> Add INtegration. Search for Bosch.
